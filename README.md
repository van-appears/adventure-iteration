# adventure-iteration

My eldest has been learning Python in Year 8 at school; good introductory stuff that reminds me of my early days of programming in BASIC like
```
name = input("What is you name?")
if name == "van appears":
  print("Hey there Van, you're great!")
else:
  print("Hello", name, "you big fool!")
```

It made me wonder what could be written with only core coding concepts for a programming language (no libraries or external packages) that would be interesting to build and extending - something you could keep adding bits to, and refining your code. I thought maybe an old-school text adventure.

I am not a game designer so I don't expect a _good_ adventure, but still this is an attempt to create a series of iterations, where each one adds a little bit more complexity to the previous version.

## running

Each version is run simply but `python version01/game.py` (changing version number as needed)
