Adding another room and a few other items creates a lot of extra states. Tracking all the states is quite hard; especially since most of them probably wouldn't ever even get actioned; there may be branches I've missed (including ones I've deliberately ignored at present, like taking the honey and eating it in a different room to the kitchen).
Instructions, inventory and a 'go to' command would be useful.
As well as the 'room' handlers, each item should probably have its own handler too. That might need much better parsing logic to split verb and noun parts of the sentence.
