Adding another room and basic navigation; also separating each room into its own function to aid readability and context. 'north' and 'south' to navigate a house are odd concepts, but there you go. navigating by room names might be better.

This was the first version that I tried on my youngest child; having not played a game like this before the concepts were not clear e.g. for 'how will you escape' the suggestion I got was 'why not go out the window?'. Instructions might be useful, even if they explain the simple 'VERB NOUN' approach of Collossal Cave Adventure.
